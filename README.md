**Modular Expert System**

---

Welcome to our Modular Expert System designed for PDF to Vector Question Answering (QA). This system efficiently processes single or multiple PDF documents, converting them into vector representations or chunks for seamless querying. Unlike systems requiring external keys such as Gemini or GPT, ours operates offline, leveraging the computational power of both CPU and GPU for processing.

### Features:

1. **PDF Parsing:** The system parses single or multiple PDF documents, extracting text and relevant metadata.

2. **Vectorization:** Utilizing advanced techniques, it converts the parsed text into high-dimensional vector representations or manageable chunks for efficient storage and retrieval.

3. **Question Answering (QA):** Equipped with a robust QA module, the system can accurately respond to queries based on the vectorized content of the PDFs.

4. **Offline Operation:** Our system operates entirely offline, eliminating the need for external keys or online services. This ensures data privacy and reduces dependency on external resources.

5. **Resource Optimization:** It intelligently utilizes both CPU and GPU resources for processing, maximizing efficiency and performance.

### Components:

1. **PDF Parser:** Responsible for extracting text and metadata from PDF documents.

2. **Vectorization Engine:** Converts text into high-dimensional vector representations or manageable chunks.

3. **QA Module:** Analyzes queries and matches them with relevant information extracted from PDFs, providing accurate responses.

### Usage:

1. **Input PDFs:** Provide one or more PDF documents containing the information you want to query.

2. **Conversion:** The system automatically converts the PDFs into vector representations or chunks suitable for QA.

3. **Querying:** Ask questions related to the content of the PDFs, and the system will provide accurate responses based on the processed data.

4. **Offline Operation:** Enjoy the convenience of offline operation without the need for external services or keys.

### Example Queries:

- "What are the key findings in the PDF titled 'Annual Report 2023'?"
- "Can you summarize the methodology discussed in the 'Research Paper' PDF?"
- "What are the main conclusions drawn from the study conducted in 'Case Study Document'?"
